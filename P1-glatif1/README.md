Summary
This Program is used to display various information about the system. Including Hardware, System and Task Information. You can toggle between which information you want shown through the menu.


Each portion of the display can be toggled with command line options. Weâ€™ll let the program do the talking by printing usage information (-h option):

[magical-unicorn:~/P1-malensek]$ ./inspector -h
Usage: ./inspector [-ahrst] [-l] [-p procfs_dir]

Options:
    * -a              Display all (equivalent to -rst, default)
    * -h              Help/usage information
    * -l              Live view. Cannot be used with other view options.
    * -p procfs_dir   Change the expected procfs mount point (default: /proc)
    * -r              Hardware Information
    * -s              System Information
    * -t              Task Information

So the task list, hardware information, system information, and task information can all be turned on/off with the command line options. By default, all of them are displayed.


In order to run the program in the Terminal:
> "make"
(*Hit enter)
> "./inspector -a"
